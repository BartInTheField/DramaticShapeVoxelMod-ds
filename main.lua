-- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts.  Voxel
-- mode is purely presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.

-- The scene canvas's size, in FRAMEBUFFER PIXELS.
--
-- `ctx.width/height` are the window measured in LOVE UNITS
-- (love.graphics.getDimensions), but the engine composites a pipeline's
-- returned canvas with `draw(canvas, 0, 0, 0, 1/dpiX, 1/dpiY)` -- a scale
-- that only covers the window when the canvas is at PIXEL resolution.
-- Sizing it in units costs the DPI scale TWICE: the canvas is that much
-- smaller, then it is drawn that much smaller again, so the diorama lands
-- in the top-left corner at 1/dpi of the screen.  Desktop never sees it --
-- units and pixels are the same thing there -- but on Android the DPI scale
-- is the display density (2.625 on a 420dpi panel), and the world came out
-- a third of the size in each direction.
--
-- So ask for the pixel dimensions rather than trusting the ctx.  That is
-- the number a fixed engine would hand over, so this keeps working either
-- way instead of double-correcting.  It also squares the FX pass: ctx.scale
-- is ALREADY in pixels per world pixel (Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale,
-- which measures the drawable), so the closures ctx.drawFx runs were being
-- scaled for a canvas 2.6x bigger than the one they drew into.

-- ------- this mod's own settings
--
-- Neither of these is a pipeline: they own no pass of the frame, they

-- instead -- see ModSetting for where they persist and how the two rows
-- each ends up on stay in step.

-- ------- this mod's hotkeys
--
--   3  VOXEL    cycle the camera ladder      (was 6)
--   5  V-GRID   toggle the wireframe         (new)
--   6  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   7  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--
-- Only 6 arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 belongs to a pair of plain mod settings
-- that own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key. Both are still reachable on
-- the OPTIONS menu, and TILT is the one this mode supersedes anyway -- the
-- registry already forces it off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the three lines after it are the
-- engine's own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

          -- FX is a full-screen present pass over the top of it. So the
          -- VOXEL key clears them on EVERY press, not just the press that

-- ------- keeping the geometry in step with the world
--
-- Terrain meshes are derived from a map's block layer, so anything that

-- has to drop that map's cached mesh or the 3D world keeps showing the
-- tree that is no longer there.  The 2D tile renderer invalidates its own
-- caches off the same edit.

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the
-- replacement builds in the background, so a one-block edit (Cut, a
-- door stamp, the tree regrowing on re-entry) repopulates in place
-- instead of blinking the whole scene down to the flat 2D path

-- A reloaded map is rebuilt from scratch (warps that re-enter the same map,
-- hot reload), so its mesh is stale for the same reason -- with one
-- exception, and it is the common one.
--
-- A palette switch reloads the map ONLY to rebuild its atlas
-- (PaletteFX.setMode -> reloadMap(id, "colors")). The geometry that comes
-- back is identical: this mesher reads block layout and tile ids and never
-- reads colour, and the palette lives entirely in the texture TerrainAtlas
-- hands back per frame -- which is keyed BY palette, so the new colours are
-- already built by the time the next frame draws.
--
-- Dropping the mesh anyway cost a visible flash of the flat 2D world on
-- every palette toggle. Mesh builds are asynchronous, so the frames between
-- the drop and the first finished mesh have no terrain to draw, and
-- drawWorld returning nil IS the 2D fallback. Keeping the geometry lets the
-- new colours land on the diorama already on screen, in one frame, which is
-- what a palette toggle should look like from inside voxel mode.
